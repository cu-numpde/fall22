* - Name
  - Objectives
* - [2022-08-24-derivatives](https://classroom.github.com/a/8I4O5IcG)
  - Use GitHub classroom and observe two kinds of numerical error: rounding error and discretization (aka. truncation) error.
* - [2022-09-19-blasius](https://classroom.github.com/a/RBCyaHyy)
  - Solve a nonlinear PDE using spectral methods. Learn libraries and assess accuracy.
* - [Community project](https://classroom.github.com/a/3AzfU4zn)
  - This has three parts: community presentation, contribution, and
retrospective presentation about the contribution experience. The goal is to
build a deeper understanding of how open source communities function, what
metrics and implicit criteria are valued, and the design decisions and norms
that went into making libraries and applications successful. In the first stage,
you' ll survey the community, and in the second, you'll gain experience making a
specific contribution of your choosing.
